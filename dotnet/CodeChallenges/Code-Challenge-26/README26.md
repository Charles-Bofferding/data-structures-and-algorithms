# Array Insertion Sorting

## Challenge
Use the psuedo code provided in the assignment to succesfully implement an array sort method.

## Approach
Please see the [BLOG.md](BLOG.md) for an in depth description of both of these.

## Efficiency
Time Efficiency: The method at the worst case will need to search over the array n times with a possible n iterations so the time factor is O(n^2)
Memory Efficiency: Because the method creates only a set number of variables and returns the original array modified the memory efficiency is O(1)

## Solution
Input an array of integers and it returns the array sorted.
