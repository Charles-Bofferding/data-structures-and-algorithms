# Reverse an Array
Whiteboard a method that will take an array and reverse the order of the objects without making a new array or using any pre-made methods

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
We used the whiteboard from the heroku virtual classroom and then used an online C# editor to write and test the code.

# Insert to Middle of an Array
Whiteboard a method that will take an array and a value and insert that value into the middle of the array with a prefference on odd length arrays to put the new value farther back rather than closer to the front.

## Approach & Efficiency
The big o efficiency for this is O(1) I think. That is more due to the simplicity of the task (looping through an array once) than it is the elegance of the solution but I will take it.

# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Given an array of sorted integers, and a value to find in that array, use the binary search method to efficiently search through the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was the standard binary search method, there was an included infographic that showed us how to do the algorithm. 
The time requirement of this search is much less than just looping through the array. I beleive the time efficiency to be O(logn). It is not O(n) because as I understand it that would be the efficiency of just searching through the arrary.
The space efficiency is very good. There are only 3 variables created and no new arrays, so an efficiency of O(n) because the array still takes up space.
