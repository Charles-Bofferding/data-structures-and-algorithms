Whiteboard a method that will take an array and reverse the order of the objects without making a new array or using any pre-made methods

## Approach & Efficiency
We used the whiteboard from the heroku virtual classroom and then used an online C# editor to write and test the code.

# Insert to Middle of an Array
Whiteboard a method that will take an array and a value and insert that value into the middle of the array with a prefference on odd length arrays to put the new value farther back rather than closer to the front.

## Approach & Efficiency
The big o efficiency for this is O(1) I think. That is more due to the simplicity of the task (looping through an array once) than it is the elegance of the solution but I will take it.
